# Book-List
A simple application to create a book list.

## Project Description
I completed this project during my Modern Javascript course. I first built the project on a ES5 feature using prototypes
syntax. Then, I created another branch and reformatted it by using ES6 classes. I also used Skeleton CSS for it's dead
simple framework.
